# Installtion troubles

* Really for an installation you are best to recheck your original instructions carefully to make sure you followed things properly.

* 3.20 As of May 2015, make sure you are running at least this version.

* 3.18 (Jan 2015) currently suffers from a showstopper install bug however.
  * https://2600hz.atlassian.net/browse/KAZOO-3227
  * Probably fixed, use a new version anyway.
