The Great Big Book Of Kazoo

These ramblings are here so I can add to them easily.  When I write them, I'm fairly sure where to find it again.  Kazoo is so large that it's easy to forget what you already learned about Kazoo.  At the same time remember, "You don't know, what you don't know".

This stuff is not for the absolute beginner.  If you are just starting Kazoo or wanting to install for the first time, this is probably not the best starting point for your adventure.

This is mostly for the system admin that gets lost looking for the Kazoo yellow brick road.  I offer you some bricks.

Think of it as tips and tricks once the platform is installed and you have made a first few calls.

In reality you should already know about the following resources at this point.

## Background

Asterisk is single server compared to the Kazoo cloud platform.  

The VOIP landscape has changed.

Asterisk is now a retail product that can be burned into disposable appliances.

## Kazoo Again

Kazoo has emerged as the successive technology for ISP, Carriers, Service providers of all kinds.

There is a cost however.  The kazoo learning curve cannot be understated!  The background of knowledge needs to be highlighted. 

Please never say that Kazoo doesn;t have some feature because you can't find it online here.  This is documenting some features that I have personally tested under various configurations.

The best documentation is the source code.
