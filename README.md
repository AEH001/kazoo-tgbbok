Kazoo and 2600hz are an really nicely engineered and awesome software.  

Asterisk is a dead end compared to the Kazoo platform.  

The VOIP landscape has changed.

Asterisk is now a retail product that can be burned into disposable appliances.

Kazoo has emerged as the successive technology for ISP, Carriers, Service providers of all kinds.

There is a cost however.  The kazoo learning curve cannot be understated!
