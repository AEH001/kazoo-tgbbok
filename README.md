The Great Big Book Of Kazoo (2600hz Open Source platform)

These ramblings are here so I can add to them easily (no approvals), and a tiny little bit of Google juice. 

When I put it here, I'm fairly sure where to find it again.  

Kazoo is so large that it's easy to forget what you already learned about Kazoo.

Remember, "You don't know, what you don't know". (TM some person before lawyers and Coryright existed)

* If you are just starting Kazoo or wanting to install for the first time...
  * https://github.com/stormqloud/kazoo-tgbbok/blob/master/127.0.0.1

If you are a new user, play with the single sever ISO.  Install it multiple times.

If you are lost, you should call/email the 2600hz folks.  They wrote the software and know it really well!!  2600hz offers a managed hosted platform.

For programmers/admin/techs and others that are trying to justify their jobs by doing themselves what 2600hz can already do better, you might find some useful things here.

This is mostly for the system admin that gets lost looking for the Kazoo yellow brick road.  

I offer you some yellow bricks.

Think of it as tips and tricks once the platform is installed and you have made a first few calls.

99.99% of the things you find here are the creation of 2600hz or other people.   I'm not the genius behind the code.

This github is a set of ideas, links etc.

You should already be familiar with the following resources at this point.

#### Websites:
* https://2600hz.com/
* http://www.kazoocon.com/
* https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo
* https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo/tree/master/applications/crossbar/doc

##### Atlassian is a nightmare IMHO.  However there is a lot of info there and in Jira.
* https://2600hz.atlassian.net/wiki/display/docs/Overview
* Make sure to get yourself a jira login.
* Links to Jira from Google will not work without a login.

### Mailing list
* `https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/2600hz-users`
  * How do I setup? How do I turn on reseller?
* `https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/2600hz-dev`
  * Dev mailing list is not for setup questions..

## Background

Asterisk is single server compared to the Kazoo cloud (http://www.beadaptive.ca/cloud-drinking-game/) platform.

The VOIP landscape has changed since Asterisk was the only Open Source VOIP project.

Asterisk strong point, an embedded core platorm with various gui stapled to the side, that can be burned into disposable appliances.  It's your $99 onsite PBX box.  It's the Swiss Army Knife for SIP (IAX die die die) and VOIP.

Asterisk is a revolutionary product.

Everybody runs Asterisk already in some form, for some purpose.  Stop thinking of Asterisk and Kazoo competing.  They are complementary products in many ways.

When you embrace Kazoo you will not be giving up Asterisk anytime soon, if ever.  Everything has it's place!

REPEAT:  I still often (moves/adds/changes) extensions.conf 

## Kazoo Again

Kazoo has emerged as the successive technology for ISP, Carriers, Service providers of all kinds.

Multi-Tennant PBX (Remember these?)

There is a cost however.  The Kazoo learning curve cannot be understated! 

Please never say that Kazoo does not have some feature because you can't find it documented online here.  The things here are mostly personally tested under various configurations by You Know Who.

The best documentation is the source code.
