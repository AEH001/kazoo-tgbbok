The Great Big Book Of Kazoo

These are here so I can add to them easily. 

This stuff is not for the absolute beginner or the expert.  Mostly the admin that gets lost along the way.

Think of it as tips and tricks once the platform is installed and you have made a first few calls.

In reality you should already know about the following resources

Asterisk is single server compared to the Kazoo cloud platform.  

The VOIP landscape has changed.

Asterisk is now a retail product that can be burned into disposable appliances.

Kazoo has emerged as the successive technology for ISP, Carriers, Service providers of all kinds.

There is a cost however.  The kazoo learning curve cannot be understated!

Please never say that Kazoo doesn;t have some feature because you can't find it online here.  This is documenting some features that I have personally tested under various configurations.

This is by no means a universal experience.
