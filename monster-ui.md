# Monster-UI

### tl;dr: Monster-UI is an awesome product.  Until callflows editor is available, it's not production.  Use Kazoo-UI.

## Monster-UI replaces Kazoo-UI 
 * Monster-UI looks awesome
 * Monster-UI is a great product
 * It's different then Kazoo-UI and makes more assumptions.
  * "thats a good thing" TM
  
## If you are new to Kazoo.
 * Kazoo-UI has more features and has a "lower level" interface.
 * Monster-UI is missing some critical apps/features in open source
  * callflows
 * Moster is missing some useful apps as well 
  * blacklists
  * developer
  * end user
  
* Change the URL but otherwise this will troll through the directory looking for apps to install
  * sup crossbar_maintenance init_apps '/var/www/html/monster-ui/apps' 'http://sip.stormqloud.ca:8000/v2'
