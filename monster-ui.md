# Monster-ui

## Monster-ui replaces Kazoo-ui 
 * Monster-ui looks awesome
 * Monster-ui is a great product
 * It's different then Kazoo-ui and makes more assumptions.
 
 * Kazoo-ui has more features and has a "lower level" interface.
 * Monster-ui is missing some critical apps/features in open source
  * callflows
 * Moster is missing some useful apps as well 
  * blacklists
  * developer
  * end user
  
* Change the URL but otherwise this will troll through the directory looking for apps to install
  * sup crossbar_maintenance init_apps '/var/www/html/monster-ui/apps' 'http://sip.stormqloud.ca:8000/v2'
