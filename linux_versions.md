# Linux versions..

## ```<flame retardant suit>```

* What version of Linux should you use for Kazoo?
  * You should only use FreeBSD, Linux is only for Penguins.
    * Just kidding
    * I love FreeBSD, but there is little Kazoo support at this time
    * Erlang on FreeBSD is super production quality
      * Ever heard of Whatsapp?
        *  https://www.erlang-solutions.com/about/news/erlang-powered-whatsapp-exceeds-200-million-monthly-users
        * a couple hundred million users on Erlag/FreeBSD
  * moving on..
 
* The answer used to be simple Centos 6
  * 2600hz distributes Centos 6 RPM's for everything..

* Centos 6 and Freeswitch (1.6+) do not "play nice"
  * dependancies..

* Centos 6 has python 2.6 baked in (boo hiss)

* Kazoo 4.0 will likely require Debian for Freeswitch   
  * This is a Freeswitch recommendation/requirement more then 2600hz

* Debian binary install packages are showing up for Freeswitch on repo.2600hz.com
