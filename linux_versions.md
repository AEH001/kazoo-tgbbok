# Linux versions..

## ```<flame retardant suit>```

* What version of Linux should you use for Kazoo?
  * You should only use FreeBSD, Linux is only for Penguins.
    * Just kidding
    * I love FreeBSD, but there is little Kazoo support at this time

* The answer used to be simple Centos 6
  * 2600hz distributes Centos 6 RPM's for everything..

* Centos 6 and Freeswitch (1.6+) do not "play nice"

* Kazoo 4.0 will likely require Debian for Freeswitch   
  * This is a Freeswitch recommendation/requirement more then 2600hz
