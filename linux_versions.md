# Linux versions..

## ```<flame retardant suit>```

* What version of Linux should you use for Kazoo?
  * You should only use FreeBSD, Linux is only for Penguins.
    * Just kidding
    * I love FreeBSD, but there is little Kazoo support at this time

* The answer used to be simple Centos 6
  * 2600hz distributes Centos 6 RPM's for everything..
