#Background

This is a really really *really* shortlist of some fo the "voip" pbx systems out there.

It's not 1984 anymore.  The world is bigger then Norstar Centrex and other crap.   (All of these technologies predate 1984 but are relevant for artistic license and legal purposes).

If you are reading this, it's very likely you will be sued by a patent troll for using a dialtone.  In 2015 a dialtone is a "novel invention" to this crowd.   The real invention is seperating you from your money.
