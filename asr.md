# ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition

New updates Spring 2016
 
## The other direction is TTS 
  * https://github.com/stormqloud/kazoo-tgbbok/blob/master/tts.md

* Option 1: OpenSource
 * If you are an academic or other dreamer, this might be for you.  
 * Anyone that can demonstrate a working system please contact me.
 * I've plaowed many hours into this without anything working.
 * Works in theory.

* Option 2: ispeech.org
  * Kazoo to ispeech.org for ASR has been fixed (yay Voxter)
  * Voxter announced at Kazoocon 2015
  * I've not tested it on Kazoo, however
    * voice recognition is hard
    * That's nothing to do with 2600hz or Kazoo.
    * Just because the voice recording hits the ispeech API doesn't mean they can recognize it!

* Option 3: google speech rec API
  * No known integration but google is doing free ASR for the moment.  Pricing to be announced after people get hooked on it.  Otherwise it will get cancelled and everybody will be screwed.

* Option 4:
  *  There is no option 4 

ASR costs per word recognized.
