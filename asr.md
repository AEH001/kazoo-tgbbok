New updates.
 
## The other direction is TTS 
  * https://github.com/stormqloud/kazoo-tgbbok/blob/master/tts.md
* Option 1: OpenSource
 * If you are an academic or other dreamer, this might be for you.  
 * Anyone that can demonstrate a working system please contact me.
 * I've plaowed many hours into this without anything working.
 * Works in theory.

* Option 2: ispeech.org
  * Kazoo to isppech.org for ASR appears broken.
  * ispeech.org changed it's API and kazoo is not updated for it.
  * there is no other 3rd party support integrated at this point.

ASR costs per word recognized.
