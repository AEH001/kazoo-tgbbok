  * https://github.com/stormqloud/kazoo-tgbbok/blob/master/tts.md

* Option 1: OpenSource
 * If you are an academic or other dreamer, this might be for you.  
 * Anyone that can demonstrate a working system please contact me.
 * I've plaowed many hours into this without anything working.
 * Works in theory.

* Option 2: ispeech.org
  * Kazoo to isppech.org for ASR has been fixed (ya Voxter)
  * Voxter announced at Kazoocon 2015
  * I've not tested but I'm sure Voxter fixed the API
    * voice recognition is hard
    * Just because the voice recording hits ispeech API doesn;t mean they can recogniez it!

* Option 3:
  *  There is no option 3 

ASR costs per word recognized.
