#WTF is Kazoo-ui
  Production UI
  
## Kazoo-ui tweaks
* Extend logout 
  * Edit ```/var/www/html/kazoo-ui/config/config.js```
    * Add ```        logout_timer: '360',```
    * This gives you 6 hours (ie 60*6 min)


#WTF is Monster-ui
  Bleeding edge UI
  
Tomato or Tomato?

The reality in 2014 is you need to run kazoo-ui for most things.

monster-ui is not fully baked yet.
