# Your Journey with Kazoo

> It's not the destination, it's the journey.
### True, but let's try this again.
#### You plant a Kazoo seed, and the damn thing needs water..
### Lies, damn lies
####  I got some servers, backups (maybe).  I wonk Kazoo.
### There is no need for waterboarding.
## I need to split or rearrange my Kazoo infrastructure and I'm fucking lost.

> You need to understand that you cannot simply install Kazoo and then leave it alone.
