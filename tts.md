# TTS - Text to Speech

* Good TTS (in multiple languages, multipe voices) is not free.
  *  There are open source options in this area.   I've worked with them and the results are not good.  
  *  Super un plus double un good.

* Kazoo uses an external API service [ispeech.org] when the functionality is called for.
  *  You will need to signup for an account and pay real money.
  
* The TTS speech quality from ispeech.org is truely awesome.
* If you buy the service and try the languages and so forth it works *really* well.  Like scary welcome to the future.

* Kazoo will cache a copy of the audio stream as a wav file inside of couchdb before you ever hear it.
  * In general you "save money" because each IVR message is only purchased once, but used over and over.
