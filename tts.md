# TTS - Text to Speech

* Good TTS (in multiple languages, multipe voices) is not free.
 
## Option 1:
  * Open source
  * There are open source options.   
    * I've burned dozens of hours testing them and the results are not good.  
    * Super double un plus good.
  * If you get awesome reults please contact me, even to report it!
    * Your time must be virtually free, or you are smarter then me.
 *  If you are starting a business proceed to Option 2 
  
## Option 2:
* Kazoo uses an external API service [ispeech.org] when the functionality is called for.
  *  You will need to signup for an account and pay real money(TM) and comissions.
  
* The TTS speech quality from ispeech.org is truely awesome.
  * Think Star Trek Voice API.

* If you buy the service and try the languages and so forth it works *really* well.
  *  Everybody should be impressed with the TTS. 

* Kazoo will cache a copy of the audio stream as a wav file inside of couchdb before you ever hear it.
  * In general you "save money" because each IVR message is only purchased once, but used over and over.

Paying ispeech solves the TTS issue.
