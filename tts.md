# TTS - Text to Speech

* Good TTS (in multiple languages, multipe voices) is not free.
  * I cannot help you get free TTS service for Kazoo.

* Kazoo uses an external API servic when the functionality is called for.
  *  You will need to signup for an account and pay real money.
  
* The TTS speech quality from ispeech.org is truely awesome.
