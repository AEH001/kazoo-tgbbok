# FAX

Kazoo has inbound and outbound faxing to/from PDF.

## Fax to Email
* This should work with no problem.  Assign a callflow with a DID number to go into "receive fax".  The "receive fax" application will associate with a user record.  The PDF will be delivered to the users email address.
* There is inbound faxbox funcationality also.  Unknown how to setup or what functionality is provided.
