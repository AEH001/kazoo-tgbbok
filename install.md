# The Install but Not Install instructions.

* Kazoo is a big project.

* It's not a question of what version I'm running at the moment.
  *  It's a question of how many Kazoo versions you have running at the same time.

 * Use stable if promted.
 * Plan to install each major version for ISO as a test enviroment.

* If you are a long time user looking to expand you cluster then you should dig in
