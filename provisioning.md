#Provisioning

As of early 2015, Provisioning is so hopelessly complicated as to be unknown in the wild.

Several people claim to have this working.  In reality, outside of 2600hz professionally hosted platform, this is not used.

To the reader: you have two options to get Provisionign working ;-)  

* Research it yourself and send me (stormqloud.ca) the instructions to prove it.

* Buy support from 2600hz.com
