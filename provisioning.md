# Provisioning

* As of early 2015, "Open Source Provisioning" is so hopelessly complicated as to be unknown in the wild.  
* 2600hz apparently has provisioning built for master-ui.  This is not an open source product as far as I can find.

* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/2600hz-dev/provisioner/2600hz-dev/573YWxdxz9E/b6okNxauIqQJ
  * "The provisioner is in a state of flux. The old one is completely unstable so weâ€™re not really encouraging people to use that at this point." 

# To the reader: you have two options to get Provisioning working ;-)  

* Buy support from 2600hz.com (good idea ;-)

* Research old unreliable provisioning yourself and send me (stormqloud.ca) the instructions!

# Open Source Provisioning (provisioner-v5)
* The old open source code is now know as provisioner-v5 in the source tree.
* It's not secure, it's unreliable
* Making a DB mistake can take out all your phones in a matter of hours.

In the meantime here are a few random things.

Do not think this is going to get provisioning installed.  Provisioning is broken and undeveloped.  Nobody can help you except yourself.

* Some random doc links (this will not match exactly the code...)

* The provisioner-v5 code
  * https://github.com/provisioner/Provisioner/tree/v5-dev

* This probably refers to code that is not open source.  IE  NOT provisioner-v5, not checked.
  * https://github.com/bluesandnz/kazoo-provisioner
* The Kazoo-ui has old provisioning code in another source tree. 
  * https://github.com/2600hz/phone
  * You should install this code inside you kazoo-ui/applications/voip folder
  * /var/www/html/kazoo-ui/whapps/voip/phone/phone.js
 
* Edit /var/www/html/kazoo-ui/config/config.js 
  * Add a line like 
  * ```        provisioner_url: '/p', ```
