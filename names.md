#Naming Conventions

Unfortunately, Kazoo has some very badly named applications that go along with it.

###Two examples

For exmaple, somebody thinks that "jonny5" is an appropriate name for the module that does limiting.

Whatever comic book reference jonny5 comes from is known only to the Kazoo developers themselves.

Another example is the `hotornot` application for `rating` calls.  IE determining call cost/price.

The main application is named `hotornot` yet the databse table it
