#Naming Conventions

Unfortunately, Kazoo has some very badly named applications that go along with it.

###Two examples before we provide a translation matrix

* `jonny5`
  * For exmaple, somebody thought that "jonny5" is an appropriate name for the module that does limiting.  Whatever comic book or other minor cultural reference `jonny5` comes from is known only to the Kazoo developers themselves.
  * In reality this is a module for controlling max channel limits for an account etc.
* `hotornot`
  * `hotornot` is an application for `rating` calls.  IE determining call cost/price.
  *  The main application is named `hotornot` yet the databse table where the values reside is called `ratedeck`
  *  The entire application should be called `ratedeck` and silly names like `hotornot` should be retired and discouraged.
