# Cluster management

* Adding and removing elements from the cluster.
 * Adding any single cluster element can usually be done fairly easily by following along with you original install instructions.
 * Removing a cluster member can be done just be turing it off and not using it again (in most cases..)

I need to elaborate on this..
